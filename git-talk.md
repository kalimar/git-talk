Github - Webapp that integrates with Git
Gist - Github tool for sharing snippets of code

* What's meant by version control?
* What is a repo
* What is a branch
* Let's use gitk - it's included with most shells
* Give a very brief demo by creating the git talk repo
> `git init` </br>
> `git add .` <!-- adds all files in directory --> </br>
> [some good thoughts] (http://lostechies.com/joshuaflanagan/2010/09/03/use-gitk-to-understand-git/) to read for how to teach git using gitk

* Greate way to test and add new features to your project
