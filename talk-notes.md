# Notes
## Version Control
* Version Control using what's considered today's standard: Git with Github
* Rather than sharing a file, like what you might do on dropbox, here you have a system that manages who does what when to the project and helps avoid accidental deletions or overwriting.
* In otherwords, you are managing what "version" of your files you are currently working on
## Branches & the Repo
* In git you create a repository (repo) - That's where your files live
* When you want to make changes to a file/files in your project you either checkout, or create a feature branch.
* Now you can make changes to your file. Test it, make sure everything works and then merge it back into the main project.
* Show example on the screen
* Now we create a new branch
    * add Title to this slide
    * Commit change
    * Go back to master
    * Create another branch
    * Add cat and dog slides
    * Commit change
    * go back to master
    * merge both into master
* Git won't easily let you merge changes that are questionable or out of sync.
## Collaborate on Projects
* Next enters Github - is a website that hosts your repositories and allows for several people to collaborate together with a nice graphical interface.
* You don't actually need to use a website to share a project with others but it certainly makes it a much nicer/easier experience
